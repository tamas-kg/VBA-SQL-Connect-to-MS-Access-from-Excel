Public Sub SQLInsertIntoDB()

' the method used below is referred to as late binding because we are not referencing the ADODB library
' in case of early binding you have to select ActiveX Data Objects x.x Library from the referrences and do the declaration as so:

'Dim cn As ADODB.Connection
'Set cn = New ADODB.Connection

'cn.ConnectionString = "Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source=" & dbPath & ";Persist Security Info=False;"

'cn.Open

'SQL goes here same as with late binding

'cn.Close

'------------------------------------------

    Dim cn As Object

    Set cn = CreateObject("ADODB.Connection")
  
    dbPath = "\\gBTcsm0010.emea.givaudan.com\HomeDirS$\kompogat\Desktop\Buchu Oil Monitor.accdb"
      
    scn = "Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source=" & dbPath & ";Persist Security Info=False;"
     
    cn.Open scn
    
    sql = "INSERT INTO QueryName SELECT * FROM [Sheet1$] IN '" & ThisWorkbook.FullName & "' 'Excel 8.0;'"
    
    cn.Execute sql
   
    Set cn = Nothing
    
End Sub
